  abstract = {An extensive soil survey was conducted to study pollution sources and delineate contamination of heavy metals in one of the metalliferous industrial bases, in the karst areas of southwest China. A total of 597 topsoil samples were collected and the concentrations of five heavy metals, namely Cd, As (metalloid), Pb, Hg and Cr were analyzed. Stochastic models including a conditional inference tree (CIT) and a finite mixture distribution model (FMDM) were applied to identify the sources and partition the contribution from natural and anthropogenic sources for heavy metal in topsoils of the study area. Regression trees for Cd, As, Pb and Hg were proved to depend mostly on indicators of anthropogenic activities such as industrial type and distance from urban area, while the regression tree for Cr was found to be mainly influenced by the geogenic characteristics. The FMDM analysis showed that the geometric means of modeled background values for Cd, As, Pb, Hg and Cr were close to their background values previously reported in the study area, while the contamination of Cd and Hg were widespread in the study area, imposing potentially detrimental effects on organisms through the food chain. Finally, the probabilities of single and multiple heavy metals exceeding the threshold values derived from the FMDM were estimated using indicator kriging (IK) and multivariate indicator kriging (MVIK). The high probabilities exceeding the thresholds of heavy metals were associated with metalliferous production and atmospheric deposition of heavy metals transported from the urban and industrial areas. Geostatistics coupled with stochastic models provide an effective way to delineate multiple heavy metal pollution to facilitate improved environmental management.}

  abstract = {Spatially explicit management strategies require the identification of appropriate spatial scales for the observation, analysis and management of fisheries. Although the mesoscale (km) is the domain of traditional fisheries stock units, there have been few attempts to describe mesoscale aggregations of scallops, typically referred to as beds. We quantified the average bed diameter of sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus) using geostatistics. Data were collected between 1999 and 2007 in the Northern Edge (NE) of Closed Area II and the Nantucket Lightship (NL) Closed Area on Georges Bank. Average bed diameter in the NE varied between 6.5 and 8.6km with classical variograms, and 7.6–9.8km with robust variograms. Average bed diameter in the NL varied between 3.0 and 10.1km with classical variograms, and 4.0–13.22km with robust variograms. There was more spatial structure in the NE. The spatial structure of the NL was less clearly defined and/or more variable. Kriged maps indicate the presence of multiple beds in both areas. Densities of ca. 1.24 scallops/m2 appeared to correspond well with the average bed diameters given by variograms. These results can be used as guidelines for the observation and analysis of the sea scallop resource in the NE and NL.}
